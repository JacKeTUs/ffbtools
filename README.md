# FFBTools

This is a set of evolving tools with documentation to help understand and debug
the FFB capabilities in GNU/Linux systems.

The goal for this project is to raise awareness of issues in FFB, specially for
steering wheels, help diagnose them and help more people get involved on fixing
them and promoting new projects.

This project is intended as the very basic foundation to get help for other
projects and initiatives. No intention to lead any effort but more to help the
potential leading developers.

Please, read the complete documentation in the [docs](docs/README.md)
directory.
