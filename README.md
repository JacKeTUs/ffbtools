# FFBTools

This is a set of evolving tools and documentation to help understand and debug
the FFB capabilities in GNU/Linux systems.

The goal for this project is to raise awareness of issues in FFB, specially for
steering wheels, help diagnose them and help more people get involved on fixing
them and collaborate on related projects.

See this project as a crutch until support and documentation for FFB
gets in better shape in the future.

Please, read the complete documentation in the [docs](docs/README.md)
directory.

## Contributing

This project's goal isn't creating new software but creating knowledge, thus
new issues can be created to ask, discuss and talk about anything related to
FFB support on Linux. Just try to keep one topic per issue, please. We hope to
bring together anyone working on FFB related projects or willing to collaborate
on them so they can find help and suppport.
