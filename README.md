# FFBTools

This is a set of evolving tools with documentation to help understand and debug
the FFB capabilities in GNU/Linux systems.

The goal for this project is to raise awareness of issues in FFB, specially for
steering wheels, help diagnose them and get more people involved on fixing
them. This should be a starting point to get better FFB support in Linux and
promote new projects.

Please, read the complete documentation in the [docs](docs/README.md)
directory.

Requirements:

 - A recent kernel.

tests, new tools and documentation.
